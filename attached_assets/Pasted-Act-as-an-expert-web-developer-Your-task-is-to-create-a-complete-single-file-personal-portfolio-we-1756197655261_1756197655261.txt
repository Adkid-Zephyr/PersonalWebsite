Act as an expert web developer. Your task is to create a complete, single-file personal portfolio website for a student named Fengshuo Liu. The website should be modern, professional, responsive, and use a clean dark-theme design. It is intended for admissions committees at top-tier U.S. Master's programs in fields like Scientific Computing and Quantitative Finance.

Please adhere to the following specifications:

1. Technology Stack:

Use HTML5.

Use Bootstrap 5 for the grid system, components (like cards and buttons), and overall styling. Ensure it's responsive.

Use Font Awesome for icons (e.g., for contact links).

All CSS and JavaScript should be included directly within the HTML file in <style> and <script> tags for simplicity. Do not create separate files.

2. Website Structure (Single Scrolling Page):

Fixed Navbar: A navigation bar that stays at the top as the user scrolls. It should contain links that smoothly scroll to the following sections: Home, About, Projects, Experience, Education, Contact.

Home (Hero Section): A full-height section with a welcoming message.

About Section: A brief introduction and skills summary.

Projects Section: Showcase key academic and personal projects using Bootstrap cards. This is the most important section.

Experience Section: A timeline of professional internships.

Education Section: Details of the dual-degree program.

Contact Section: Links to social and professional profiles.

Footer: A simple footer with a copyright notice.
